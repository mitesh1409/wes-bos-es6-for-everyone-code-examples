# Module-4: Destructuring

## Destructuring Objects

We can destructure object properties into variables.
For this to work variable name must be same as object property name.

We can rename the variables got from destructuring the object.
We can also set the default values for the variables got from destructuring the object.

It is also possible to destructure the limited props from an Object/Array.

## Destructuring Arrays

## Swapping Variables with Destructuring

## Destructuring Functions - multiple returns and named defaults
